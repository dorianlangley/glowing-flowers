        hey clara,<br><br>
        this was supposed to be a simple personal project, just something fun to help me practice and maybe show you too. i really thought i’d finish it in a day, but i got all tangled up. the css (the part that makes it look pretty) just stopped working out of nowhere, the music wouldn’t play, the buttons broke, and i couldn’t even find where the errors were hiding.<br><br>
        when i said i’d been playing games till 2am... well, i won’t lie, i was gaming a lot, but for a few minutes in between matches i was actually trying to fix the site too. then i started getting anxious ‘cause you weren’t answering, and i thought maybe i did something wrong. and well, even now (7:26pm on may 21st), you still haven’t replied, so... maybe i did. sorry if that’s the case.<br><br>
        i don’t even know if i’ll finish this tonight, or if i’ll actually send it to you. i’m kind of embarrassed sending it while you haven’t replied yet. so if you don’t… it might just gather dust in my laptop.<br><br>
        i was really happy to find you again and thought it’d be nice to make something simple just to show that. like a “oh my god he’s giving me virtual flowers” kind of thing (which, looking back, sounds kinda cringe… and probably makes no sense, just fyi, the flowers are the ones in the gif lol). but in the end it looks more like a busted quiz made by an underpaid nerdy intern. but hey, i tried. i swear.<br><br>
(quick sidenote: it’s now 24th, 5:48am, and i finally finished this thing 🙏🙏 i woke up early by accident and just decided, “okay, i’m getting this done.” a few things are still missing here and there, but i think it’s good enough now lol. no idea why this gave me such a hard time, was supposed to be simple but it ended up throwing errors all over the place 💀)<br><br>
        anyway, not trying to be weird or intense or anything, i just genuinely thought it was really cool finding you again. felt like doing something small just ‘cause i wanted to, no big deal.<br><br>
        hope this janky lil site with sketchy url energy gave you at least one smile.<br><br>
